Ok this is my startpage. To use this simply git clone and create a file `secrets.js`. It should have this inside it.

```js
var secrets = {
  username : "LASTFM_USERNAME",
  key : "LASTFM_API_KEY"
}
```
Or simply remove the code involving last.fm but thats hard and who knows.

Here are the places I stole code from xD.

- Now playing widget and js and css for that: https://prashant.me/ (more specifically https://prashant.me/development/2018/03/04/creating-a-web-widget-to-get-currently-playing-song-tracks-using-lastfm.html)
- Also this repo as an inspiration and stealing the clock JS (https://github.com/migueravila/Bento)
